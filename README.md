==================

Control OpenDMX hardware from Processing (Windows Only)

Simple library for controlling an OpenDMX device from Windows, directly in Processing. Currently, this is output only.

This library only works on Windows. In particular, this program assumes you've installed the appropriate drivers for your OpenDMX device and you have the FTD2XX.DLL. You can find these drivers at:

INSTALLATION

To install, click the "Download ZIP" button on this page and place the "opendmx" folder in your Processing libraries folder.
